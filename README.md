## Installation

As this is a website build from the Create React App with a back end via Node/Express, installation would include forking the repository, cloning the repo to your local machine, and then installing the dependencies with npm install. Once fully installed, you can run the app from the parent folder via the run start command using npm. This will pull up the website on Localhost 3001. You will also need to use another terminal or cmd window to cd into the backend folder and start the server by running nodemon server.js

## Usage

Once on the website, you can do a few things. To view currently scheduled appointments scroll down to view the table of dates and times. From this table it also allows you to edit or delete appointments. On the home page, you can click Book Now or the Schedule link at the top of the page and it will take you to a calendar view for you to be able to schedule a future date and time.

On the back end, each new submission of this calendar view will create a database entry with the information of date and time.  You can edit or delete an entry from the home page. and it will update the database and display accordingly on the frontend.
